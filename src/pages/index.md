      The textbook
      <a target="_blank" class="animated-link" href="https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/">Bioinformatics Algorithms: an Active Learning Approach</a>
      has now
      been adopted by
      <a target="_blank" class="animated-link" href="https://bioalgorithms.ucsd.edu/pubs_books.html">140+ instructors from 40+ countries</a>.
      Since all these instructors cover similar
      materials, we have decided to launch a multi-university bioinformatics class that will bring
      multiple instructors together to enhance the educational experience of students across all
      participating universities and to facilitate the exchange of the course materials and pedagogical
      ideas between various instructors.

      In Winter 2021, the multi-university class will include classes at Carnegie Mellon University, Johns
      Hopkins University, Princeton University, Saint Petersburg University, and University of
      California at San Diego. Each class at these universities will be completely independent with its
      own schedule, policies, HWs, exams, and grading. However, students in each class will be
      offered an opportunity to use various materials in the multi-university class as specified by the
      individual instructors. The multi-university class will use the
      <a target="_blank" class="animated-link" href="https://us.edstem.org/">Ed Digital Learning platform</a>
      to
      facilitate communication between students and instructors from various universities. For
      example, if you decide to post a question on Ed, it can be answered by a student or a professor
      from other universities.
